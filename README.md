# CS46B Introduction to Data Structures Lab

This lab's objective is to drive our focus in reading in data from txt files, working with arraylists, and get first-hand experience with git. The program has us create Address Book objects that utilize arraylist data structures.

The deptdir.txt file data should be populated before continuation. Typical format should take the form of:
```
<lastName>
Phone
<phoneNumber>
<firstName
Email
<email>
```
But do change up the formatting because the code should include error handling.


This repository is called SouljaBoy because of the song Kiss Me Thru the Phone, in which he repeats a phone number, and this project has a lot of phone numbers. There's no kissing involved in this class, however.
